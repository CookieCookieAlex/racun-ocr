# racun-ocr (TroÅ¡komjer)


This project is an OCR-based tool for scanning grocery receipts.
It extracts items, prices, totals, store, and date, then saves everything into a database for analysis.

The goal: help people track their spending, compare prices between stores, and see trends over time.

Features

Extracts text from receipt images (OpenCV + Tesseract/EasyOCR)

Parses store name, date, items, and totals

Saves results into PostgreSQL

FastAPI backend for uploading and querying receipts

Future plans: price trends, budgeting, store comparisons
